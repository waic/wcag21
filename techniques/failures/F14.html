         <h2>Important Information about Techniques</h2>
         <p>See <a href="https://waic.jp/docs/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to show how identifying content only by
               its visual shape or location makes content difficult to understand and operate.
               When only visual identification or location is used, users with visual
               disabilities may find it difficult to locate content since they cannot see
               the screen or may perceive only a small portion of the screen at one time.
               Also, location of content can vary if page layout varies due to variations
               in font, window, or screen size.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>The navigation instructions for a site state, "To go to next page,
                  press the button to the right. To go back to previous page, press
                  the button to the left." 
               </li>
               
               <li>A user is reading a news article in an on-line newspaper. The article
                  contains an illustration and additional links for more information.
                  Within the text of the article is a statement, "Please see sidebar
                  to the left of the illustration for links to additional
                  information." An assistive technology user would have difficulty
                  finding the illustration and the sidebar. Some alternatives would be
                  to include the list of links within the text; to provide an in-page
                  link within the text which links to the sidebar; to provide a
                  heading for the sidebar which can be used for navigation and refer
                  to the heading in the instructions.
               </li>
               
               <li>A user is completing an on-line survey. There are three buttons at
                  the bottom of the survey form. The instructions state, "Press the
                  square button to exit the survey without saving, Press the triangle
                  button to save in-progress survey results. You may return later to
                  complete the survey. Press the round button to submit the survey
                  results." A screen reader user or a user unable to distinguish shapes cannot determine
                  which button is
                  square, triangular, or round. The buttons must have additional
                  information to indicate their functions or their shapes.
