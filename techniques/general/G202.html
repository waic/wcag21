            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section

            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to provide keyboard operation for all the functionality
               of the page. When all functionality of content can be operated through a keyboard
               or keyboard interface, it can be operated by those with no vision as well as by those
               who must use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard emulators like
               speech input software or on-screen keyboards.
            </p>
            <p>A <a href="https://waic.jp/docs/WCAG21/#dfn-keyboard-interface">keyboard interface</a> allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the computing device
               that they are using does not contain a hardware keyboard. For example, many mobile
               devices have keyboard interfaces within their operating system as well the option
               to connect external wireless keyboards. Applications can use the interface to obtain
               keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other services that provide
               simulated keyboard output, such as switch devices, handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text
               applications.
            </p>
            <p>To implement this technique, first determine what functionality is available to users
               on the page. In this step, it is important to consider functions performed using both
               the mouse and the keyboard together. Examples of functionality include the use of
               physical controls such as links, menus, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons and form
               fields as well as the use of features like drag and drop, selecting text, resizing
               regions or bringing up context menus. Other examples of functionality may based on
               tasks such as adding or removing an item from a shopping cart or initiating a chat
               session with a sales representative.
            </p>
            <p>Once the functionality of the content has been determined, the author verifies that
               each of the functions identified can be performed using only the keyboard.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  <p>This does not necessarily mean that each of the individual controls can be used from
                     the keyboard as long as there are multiple methods to perform the same function available
                     on the page. Authors are advised to consider how users will discover any keyboard
                     equivalents which are available.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A page with images used as links changes when the user hovers over the image with
                  a mouse. To provide keyboard users with a similar experience, the image is also changed
                  when a user tabs to it.
               </li>
               
               <li>A page that allows users to click and drag items in a list to reorder them also includes
                  a series of controls that allows keyboard users to move items up, down or to the beginning
                  and end of the list.
               </li>
               
               <li>The mobile version of a web site includes a menu button that is tapped to open a site
                  menu, which is implemented as a floating overlay. To provide access to people using
                  external keyboards or ability switches with their mobile device, the menu button and
                  the site menu are both implemented such that they can be operated via the mobile device's
                  keyboard interface.
