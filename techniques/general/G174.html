         <p>See <a href="https://waic.jp/docs/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific

            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>When the contrast between the text and its background for some portion of the page
               has not been designed to meet the contrast level for
               <a href="https://waic.jp/docs/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum">Success Criterion 1.4.3</a>
               or
               <a href="https://waic.jp/docs/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced">1.4.6</a>, it is possible to meet these guidelines using the "Alternate Version" clause in
               the conformance requirements (<a href="https://waic.jp/docs/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conf-req1">Conformance Requirement 1</a>). A link or control on the page can either change the page so that all aspects conform,
               or it could take the viewer to a new version of the page that does conform at the
               desired level. Placing the link or control prominently on the page will assist users
               in accessing the conforming content readily.
            </p>
            <p>For this technique to be used successfully, three things must be true:</p>
            <ol>
               
               <li>The link or control on the original page must itself meet the contrast requirement
                  of the desired SC. (If the user cannot see the control they may not be able to use
                  it to go to the new page.)
               </li>
               
               <li>The new page must contain all the same information and functionality as the original
                  page.
               </li>
               
               <li>The new page must conform to all of the SC for the desired level of conformance. (i.e.,
                  the new page cannot just have the desired level of contrast but otherwise not conform).
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            <p>This technique can be used to meet Success Criterion 1.4.3 by having text (or images
               of text) on the alternate version of the page be 4.5:1 contrast and any large text
               (or images of large text) be 3:1 contrast with its background. If the alternate version
               of the page has all text (or images of text) with 7:1 contrast and large text (or
               images of large text) with 4.5:1 contrast then it would satisfy both Success Criterion
               1.4.3 and 1.4.6.

                  <p>This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present
                     a page that is a

            <ul>
               
               <li>A page with some headlines that do not meet the 3:1 contrast requirements has a high
                  contrast (5:1) link at the top of the page that takes the user to a new version of
                  the page with minimum 4.5:1 contrast on all text and images of text.
               </li>
               
               <li>A page uses shaded backgrounds for effect but results in text to background contrast
                  of 4:1. A control at the top of the page says "high contrast". Clicking on it causes
                  different styles to be used and dropping the background colors to achieve 7:1 contrast.
