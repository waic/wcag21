            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to create an <code class="obj">AutomationPeer</code> class
               				for a custom Silverlight control. The <code class="obj">AutomationPeer</code> exposes
               				accessibility properties of the control in a way that abstracts the
               				Silverlight technology specifics of the control model and maps information
               				to UI Automation concepts, so that these properties can be consumed
               				by the UI Automation accessibility framework. 
            </p>
            <p>The AutomationPeer concept is part of the overall architecture design
               				of the UI Automation system. The peer represents a deliberate abstraction
               				of the control, such that a client can obtain pattern-based information
               				about the specific purpose and capability of a control without knowing
               				its implementation-specific object model or having to resort to using
               				a framework-specific object model API. Also, the peers run in a different
               				process than the controls they represent, which has performance and
               				security advantages. For more information on UI Automation architecture,
               				see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms747327.aspx">UI
                  					Automation Overview on MSDN</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>Creating a custom Silverlight control is one way that Silverlight
               				application authors can create user interface components either for
               				their own application, or as a packaged redistributable that provides
               				the control UI for third parties. Creating an automation peer for a
               				custom control reports control-specific information to the UI Automation
               				accessibility framework, and enables a custom control to participate
               				in all of the same techniques involving UI Automation that can be used
               				for a control that is distributed in the core Silverlight run time.
               				Assistive technologies can use the UI Automation accessibility framework
               				to discover the name and role of the user interface component, and
               				can get and set values by accessing UI Automation patterns. UI Automation
               				thus supports extensibility, while maintaining a discovery system for
               				names, roles and values of UI components. 
            </p>
            <p>Control authors associate a peer with a class by implementing a method
               				override for the class implementation. Control authors declare name
               				and role through properties that are general to any UI Automation peer.
               				Control authors expose the means to get and set values by choosing
               				to support one or more patterns that are usually associated with a
               				role. For example, a control in the role of "Button" would
               				typically support an "Invoke" pattern. A consumer of UI Automation
               				could check whether the pattern was supported and then call the pattern-based
               				method Invoke, which would activate the button without
               				any device input events being produced or required. 
            </p>
            <p>By convention, controls and their automation peers share a naming
               				pattern. For example, if a control is named <code class="obj">Spinner</code>, its automation
               				peer is named <code class="obj">SpinnerPeer</code>. However, the actual wiring for the class-peer
               				association is made in the control code by overriding OnCreateAutomationPeer.
               				Thus it is necessary to have access to the control code in order to
               				associate a new peer class implementation with that control. 
            </p>
            <p>In addition to properties, automation peers can also expose methods
               				as part of the implemented UI Automation control pattern. For example,
               				a peer implementing the Value pattern can provide an implementation
               				of the SetValue method. The SetValue method
               				can be called by a UI Automation client in order to programmatically
               				set the value of the owner control. The functionality exposed by the
               				implementation of a control pattern can be accessed either by automation-based
               				testing, or by assistive technologies.

               <h3>Example 1: SimpleNumericUpDown control and its peer</h3>
               <p>The example implements a very simple Silverlight custom control named
                  						SimpleNumericUpDown. The control is a templateable control, meaning
                  						that the UI is defined in a XAML file that serves as the default UI,
                  						but any consumer of the control can change the visual appearance by
                  						applying a new template. Nevertheless, the basic accessibility characteristics
                  						of the control can be shaped by the control author, and can apply even
                  						for cases where the visible UI is noticably different. This separation
                  						between design-implementation and code-behavior is one reason for the
                  						peer-owner design in UI Automation. The majority of the example shows
                  						the C# code, including the followingÂ :

               <h3>Procedure</h3>
               
               <ol>
                  
                  <li> Using a browser that supports Silverlight, open an HTML page that
                     					references a Silverlight application through an object tag. To see
                     					UI Automation, use Microsoft Windows as platform. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Use a verification tool that is capable of showing the full automation
                     						tree, and an objectâs UI Automation properties and patterns as part
                     						of the tree. (For example, use UIAVerify or Silverlight Spy; see
                     						Resources links.) Select the item in the automation tree that is
                     						accessing the relevant custom automation peer implementation. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Examine the set of properties exposed in the tree. Check that
                     							name is reported by Name, that the class name is reported as ClassName,
                     							and that there is a role as reported by the value of ControlType. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> If the control is expected to report a value, check that the value
                     								is reported in the tree somehow. (Exactly which property reports
                     								the value varies depending on the control function and pattern; for
                     								more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff486375%28VS.85%29.aspx">Windows
                        									Automation API</a>). 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Check whether a control pattern is reported in the tree. If a
                     										control pattern is reported, test the methods of that pattern using
                     										facilities in the verification tool. Verify that invoking the methods
                     										has changed the corresponding read only property values in the tree. 
                  </li>
