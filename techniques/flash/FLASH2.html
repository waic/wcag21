            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a long text  alternative that serves
               the same purpose and presents the same  information as the original non-text content
               when a short text  alternative is not sufficient. 
            </p>
            <p>The Flash Player supports long text alternatives to non-text  objects, which can be
               defined in ActionScript or within Flash authoring  tools using the <code class="prop">description</code> property, as indicated in the examples  below.

               <h3>Example 1: Applying a Description for a symbol (graphic, button or movieclip)</h3>
               <p>The Flash Professional authoring tool's Accessibility panel lets  authors provide
                  accessibility information to assistive technology and  set accessibility options for
                  individual Flash objects or entire Flash  applications. 
               </p>
               <ol>
                  
                  <li> For a text alternative to be applied to a non-text object, it must be saved as a
                     symbol in the movie's library. <em>Note:</em> Flash does not support text alternatives for graphic symbols. Instead,  the graphic
                     must be converted to or stored in a movie clip or button  symbol. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Bring up the Accessibility panel by selecting "Window &gt;  Other Panels &gt; Accessibility"
                     in the application menu, or through  the shortcut ALT + F11. Ensure that the 'Make
                     object accessible'  checkbox is checked. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Select the non-text instance on the movie stage, the fields in the Accessibility
                     panel become editable. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Enter a description describing the non-text object's contents  concisely. For example,
                     a diagram could have a 'name' identifying what  information the diagram conveys, while
                     the 'Description' field lists  this information in full detail. Alternatively, for
                     an animation which  is part of an instructional movie about car repairs the name could
                     be:  'how to replace a flat tire', while the long description describes each  step
                     of the process in greater detail. 
                  </li>

               <p>
                  								       <em>Important:</em> Only use the 'Description' field if a short text  alternative is not sufficient to
                  describe the objects purpose.  Otherwise, leave the 'Description' field empty.

                  <li> Publish the SWF file </li>
                  
                  <li> Open the SWF file in Internet Explorer 6 or higher (using  Flash Player 6 or higher),
                     or Firefox 3 or higher (using Flash Player 9  or higher) 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Use a tool which is capable of showing an object's long description, such as ACTF
                     aDesigner 1.0 to open the Flash movie. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> In the GUI summary panel, loop over each object which is  contained by the Flash
                     movie and ensure the object that was provided a  description has a proper description
                     value appearing in the tool's  display. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Authors may also test with a screen reader, by reading the  Flash content and listening
                     to hear that the description is read when  tabbing to the non-text object (if it is
                     tabbable) or hearing the  alternative text read when reading the content line-by-line.
